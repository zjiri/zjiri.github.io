### SURMA
Horror game set in Lapland where you need to find your car keys and get to the car to win made with unity. My responsibilities were player controllers, git and code lead meaning I helped my fellow students with all problems regarding coding, git, unity and helping design gameplay so that programmers had enough time to work on their responsibilities before adding more.
